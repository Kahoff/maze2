Simple Maze 
Version 1.0

Kyle Hoffmann - April 04/15

A simple maze that has the user press the arror keys to find the exit. The user is a '*' safe tiles are '0', walls are 'X' and 
  the exit is a 'w'. 

This game started as a modification of Clock Town Grind, in an attempt to make it so I could add animation but the screen 
  flicker led me to scrap the project and turn it into a maze.
